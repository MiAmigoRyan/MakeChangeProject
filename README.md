# MakeChangeProject

## Overview
description of project

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Eclipse
- Git
- Google
- Web3schools
- Coffee maker

## Lessons Learned
- I learned a lot about the process of building a program. I did not apply loops effectively on my first iteration of the project. 
In the future I think I'll invest more time into the psudo code and planning.
- In this project I spent a lot of time playing with nested loops but eventually realized that my mathamatics were incorrect rather than the logic
- Using the Math.round(double) was more effective than "double*100" to round. 
- casting a double to an int will turncate or remove which can be problematic, shown by test 4.
- After creating a working program I realized that loops are not needed. I re-wrote the program without loops, original solution is commented out.
- I also re-organized the declarations to improve readability.

## Further questions
- How to automate the testing step.
- Shortcut to toggle windows in the eclipse IDE 

## hints given by instructors
- cast : I used this
- truncation from double to int : I understand this now
- using the modulus operator : my first iteration I did not use the modulus operator. I used it eventually and understand how the remainder is a helpful value to use. 
- casting lab is another hint : I never looked back at the casting lab...
